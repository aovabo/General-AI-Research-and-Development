## Introduction

This repository documents my journey and progress in becoming a Full-Stack AI Systems Engineer.  I'm focused on building a strong foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of AI, with a particular emphasis on:

*   **Large Language Models (LLMs):**  Pre-training, fine-tuning, and leveraging pre-trained models.
*   **Small Language Models**
*   **AI Application Development:** Building practical, real-world applications using AI.
*   **AI Systems Engineering:** Designing, deploying, and maintaining AI-powered systems.
My ultimate goal is to contribute to the field by publishing high-quality research papers and developing useful AI applications.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following directories:

*   **`/code`:**  Contains all code related to projects, experiments, and tutorials.  
    
*   **`/papers`:**  Summaries, notes, and implementations related to research papers I'm studying.
  
      
*   **`/notebooks`:**  Jupyter/Colab notebooks for experimentation, data analysis, and prototyping.
  

  *   **`/resources`:**  Links to helpful articles, tutorials, courses, and other learning materials.
  
*   **`/certificates`:**  Scans or links to certificates earned from online courses and certifications.


## Current Focus

*   Currently, I'm focused on mastering the fundamentals of LLM fine-tuning and building useful AI applications using existing models and frameworks.
